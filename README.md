# Diabetes Diagnosis Using Modified Crow Search Algorithm (CSA) and Harmonic Search (HS)

This repository contains the implementation of a **Diabetes Diagnosis System** based on a hybrid approach combining the **Crow Search Algorithm (CSA)** and **Harmonic Search (HS)**. The goal is to accurately predict diabetes in patients by optimizing feature selection using these metaheuristic algorithms.

## Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic disease that occurs either when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or when the body cannot effectively use the insulin it produces. This project aims to develop a highly accurate prediction system for diagnosing diabetes by modeling it as a **multi-objective optimization problem**.

## Project Overview

This system is designed to predict diabetes using the **PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset**. The main innovation in this project is the **hybrid approach** that combines:

- **Crow Search Algorithm (CSA):** A population-based optimization algorithm that mimics the intelligent behavior of crows.
- **Harmonic Search (HS):** A metaheuristic algorithm inspired by musical harmony processes, used for enhancing the optimization process.

By merging these algorithms, we enhance the feature selection process and optimize the classification task to predict diabetes more accurately.
